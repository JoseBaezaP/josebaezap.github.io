**Hello!** I'm Jos√© Baeza, but you can call me Pepe. My passion for programming began when I was about 10 years old, when I hacked my first phone.

A great achievement for me has been venturing into entrepreneurship, creating solutions for businesses. My main success has been creating a management platform for a parcel delivery service, helping them improve their productivity and organization.

As a programmer and business analyst, I enjoy solving problems and creating solutions that help businesses improve their efficiency. I love learning new technologies and am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
